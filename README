-----AutoBackup made by Relentless_x-----

#####Info#####

#AutoBackup will backup a specified directory every x minuets (you specifiy the minuets)

#I made this for the purpose of minecraft servers but it will backup ANY directory!

#####Instructions for use#####

#Start up the AutoBackup (On windows run "Run Autobackup (Windows)" 
 on linux and mac run it how you would usually run a jar 
 (sorry i cannot be of more assistance!).

#AutoBackup Will then create is save directory.

#It will then ask you for the path of the directory you want to bakup
 for example C:\Users\Jamal\Desktop\Server\world  Type (or paste) it in
 and hit Enter.

#Next it will ask you for the directory name you want to be backed up
 this should be the last part of the directory path so for the example
 above it would be world.

#Next it will ask you the delay you want between backups, this is in
 intervals of one minuet so one hour you would type in 60 two hours
 you would type in 120 ect. then hit enter.

#AutoBackup has now started and will back up the selected directory at
 every x minuets (x beign the specified number).

#To stop AutoBackup just click X it won't harm anything (but if you X
 it whilst its backing up the backup will not be complete)

#####Other Info#####

#If people use this and find it useful i may add a gui to it to make it more user friendly!

#I reccomend you dont chose to backup at short intervals, you could find yourself speedily 
 running out of hard drive space
